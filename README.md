# Concept-Understanding-Examples

This repository contains some programs created as part of my SIT102 T1/25 unit. Each program is an example of understanding of these following concepts: Enums, Passing by Reference, and Structs. 

The final program labelled Shop Manager, is a program that was built completely by myself by incorporating the concepts from above into a single program. 

The shop program allows for the creation of a 'Shop', it then allows the shop owner to add, find, remove and update products. The program is able to track statistics about products, including quantity on hand, sale price, and purchase price, as well as store sales, and profit margins. 

The UI of this program is a simple terminal based UI, and receives input based on integer options.
